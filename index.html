	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I'm from <strong>Xalapa, Ver.</strong> So.. if you know something about Xalapa it means that you know someting about me, if not don't worry I'm about to tell you about it. Xalapa it's a small city full of cultural activities, parks, galeries and a lot of open-air activities. <em>It's like a city inside a forest and mountains</em></p>
		<p>I studied only untill I finished <em>Highschool</em> afther that I start working at multiple places but I always came back and work with my parent's at the family business, they need help and I was always willing to help them, at the end I get a job in a callcenter at Mexico City so I moved to a new place, I did't know anything about the big city untill I came here, since then I'm living at <strong>CDMX!</strong></p>
		<p>Maybe I was working in a good place and everything was ok but you know, I never stop looking for new oportunities, thats how I get into a new experience called Holacode, by far I think that it's one of the best oportunities that I can get by far and I have big expectations about this.</p>
	<h4>My Hobbies</h4>
		<p>I really enjoy when I go out to the movies and after go to eat something really good, I love to go to the museum, a park or just a walk with my boyfriend or if I go by myself with some good music.</p>
		<p>But I also love to be at home, watch movies and cuddle with my Boy and our dogs and cat.</p>
